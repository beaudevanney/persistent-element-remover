This addon can remove elements (annoyances) which are inserted dynamically after pageload

<b>Q:</b> Why do i need this when i have an Adblocker like uBlock Origin or similar.
<b>A:</b> To my knowledge, no blocker as of yet has the feature to continuously   monitor for and remove elements

<b> Usage  </b>
<ol>
<li> Visit the page you want to create a rule for
</li>
<li>write a matching url_regex for the site, for example  <i>^https:\/\/www\.<domain>\.<ext>.*</i> , replace <domain> and <ext> with fitting values.
   (can be tested via https://regex101.com/ )
</li>
<li>Next, open the "Tools" -> "Web Developer Tools" menu (shortcut: CTRL+SHIFT+I)
</li>
<li>Use the element picker  (at top left corner of the development
   tools window)  to inspect the element you want to remove
</li>
<li>Find a unique identifiert for the elements.
   => This can be difficult but in most cases it will just be a "class" name (for example "promotedlink")
      found inside the html element ("div")

</li>
<li>Add and save the css selector (code)  and the url regex (url_regex) as a rule to via the add-ons preference page.
</li>
<li>Open or Reload the page, and the elements should be removed
</li>
</ol>

<b>EdgeCase: </b>
<b>Q: </b> What can i do if there is no unique css identifier for the elements i want removed?
<b>A: </b> Besides using css selectors, you can also use javascript code to identify the page element. Example: '<i> "return (document.querySelectorAll("div.promotedlink"));"</i>)
